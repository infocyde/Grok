**What is this?**

I wanted to test out the grok-beta API so I started working on this streamlit wrapper for it.  I'm using the OpenAI Python Package since Grok is compatible with it.

Note: You need a Grok API Key to run this.

This runs, and displays output, but the UI is not finished.  All the time I could put into it for tonight.  

Installation (Windows...but similar steps in other environments, translate as you go)
In Visual Studio Code or Similar IDE
1. Create a virtual environment (I use venv)
2. Open a terminal window
3. Type python -m venv .venv
4. When complete, type .venv\scripts\activate
5. Make sure your virtual environment is active
6. Type pip install -r requirements.txt
7. Make sure you have a .env file with your xAI Key or hardcode it in the app.py page

Have Fun

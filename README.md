What is this?

I wanted to test out the grok-beta API so I started working on this streamlit wrapper for it.  I'm using the OpenAI Python Package since Grok is compatible with it.

Note: You need a Grok API Key to run this.

This runs, and displays output, but the UI is not finished.  All the time I could put into it for tonight.  

Installation (Windows...but similar steps in other environments, translate as you go)
In Visual Studio Code or Similar IDE
1. Create a virtual environment (I use venv)
   a. open a terminal window
   b. type python -m venv .venv
   c. When complete, type .venv\scripts\activate
   d. make sure your virtual environment is active
   e. type pip install -r requirements.txt
   f. Make sure you have a .env file with your xAI Key or hardcode it in the app.py page

Have Fun
